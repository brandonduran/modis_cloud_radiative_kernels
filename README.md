# modis_cloud_radiative_kernels

SW cloud radiative kernel developed using zonal mean temperature and humidity profiles averaged across control runs of four CMIP6-era climate models as input to the RRMTG radiation code. These are best for diagnosing feedbacks relative to a modeled pre-industrial climate state. Please refer to Wall et al. (2023) and Duran et al. (in prep) for details.
